zipper.php is a php program that creates zip archives. 

It requires that the ZipArchive class be available:

...you'll get a hang or error if it does not.  

The program also hard codes the input files and output zip PATH. 

You need to edit those lines or create /tmp/one.txt, /tmp/two.txt, /tmp/three.txt and then look for /tmp/onetwothree.zip
